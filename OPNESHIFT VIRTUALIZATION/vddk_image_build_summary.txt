VDDK Image Build and Push – Summary

✅ Objective:
Build a VDDK container image and push it to the internal OpenShift registry (SNO setup) for use in MTV (Migration Toolkit for Virtualization).

✅ Successful Steps

1. Extracted VDDK tarball:
   - Unzipped the provided `vddk` tar file on the bastion/SNO node.

2. Identified internal OpenShift registry service:
   - Verified using:
     oc get service image-registry -n openshift-image-registry
     - Result: ClusterIP on port 5000.

3. Logged in to internal registry from SNO node:
   podman login --tls-verify=false -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
   - Success message: Login Succeeded!

4. Built the VDDK image using podman:
   podman build -t image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/mtv/vddk:latest .

5. Pushed the image to OpenShift internal registry:
   podman push --tls-verify=false image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/mtv/vddk:latest

6. Configured the image path in MTV GUI:
   - Used:
     image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/mtv/vddk:latest

⚠️ Issues Faced

1. DNS Resolution Failure from Bastion:
   - Error: no such host
   - Cause: Bastion node could not resolve internal service DNS (not part of cluster network).
   - Fix: Switched to running all steps directly on the SNO node.

2. Missing token for oc whoami -t:
   - On SNO node, no valid kubeconfig was present under core user.
   - Fix: Used manual token login or ensured kubeconfig availability.

3. Hanging podman login from Bastion:
   - Reason: Could not reach the registry service from outside the cluster.
   - Fix: Ran podman login from within the SNO node.

✅ Final VDDK Image Path Used:
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/mtv/vddk:latest
